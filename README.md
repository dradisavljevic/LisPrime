# Lisp Prime and Coprime Numbers
Implementation of couple of algorithms I used for an university project, for which I could not find an adequate implementation online.

isprime.lisp -> Holds implementation of the function that checks whether or not a given number is a prime number.

primes-between.lisp -> Implementation of the function that for two given numbers returns a list of all prime numbers in between them.

prime-factors.lisp -> Function that, for a given number, does prime factorization on it.

coprime.lisp -> Function that checks whether or not the second given parameter is a coprime number of the first one.

coprimes-list.lisp -> For a given number, function returns a list of all of its coprime numbers.

modular-multiplicative-inverse.lisp -> For given e and totient parameters returns the their modular multiplicative inverse. Used in the RSA implementation.

prime-numbers.lisp -> Lisp file that holds collective implementation of all the functions mentioned above.
